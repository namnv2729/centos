On your server, use wget and paste the link that you copied in order to download the archive file:
wget http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.30/node-v0.10.30.tar.gz

Extract the archive and move into the new directory by typing:
tar xzvf node-v* && cd node-v*

There are a few packages that we need to download from the CentOS repositories in order to compile the code. Use yum to get these now:
sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++

Now, we can configure and compile the software:
./configure
make

The compilation will take quite awhile. When it is finished, you can install the software onto your system by typing:
sudo make install

To check that the installation was successful, you can ask Node to display its version number:
node --version
